First of all, this calculator doesn't perform multiple operations in a single instruction. Also, the input need that there's not spaces bettwen 
characters.

This calculator has many mathematical functions, the syntax will be described bellow....

Aritemtic functions:
 Add: x+y  where x and y are real numbers.
 Subtract: x-y  where x and y are real numbers.
 Multiplication: x*y  where x and y are real numbers.
 Division: x/y  where x and y are real numbers.
 Power: x^y  where x and y are real numbers.
 Root: x|y  where x and y are real numbers -> (radicand|index).
 Decimal log: :log(x) where x is a real number.
 Natural log: :logn(x) where x is a real number.

Vector algebra:
 Cross Product: [x,y,z]x[x,y,z] where x, y and z are real numbers.
 Vectorial add: [x,y,z]+[x,y,z] where x, y and z are real numbers.
 Vectorial subtract: [x,y,z]-[x,y,z] where x, y and z are real numbers.
 Vectorial multiplication: [x,y,z]*[x,y,z] where x, y and z are real numbers.
 Vectorial division: [x,y,z]/[x,y,z] where x, y and z are real numbers.

Trigonometric functions:
 Sine: :sin(x) where x is a real number.
 Cosine: :cos(x) where x is a real number.
 Tan: :tan(x) where x is a real number.
 Arctan: :act(x) where x is a real number.

To operate with an aritmetic answer saved in memory, type: ans+x where x is a real number.
To operate with a vector answer saved in memory, type: ans+x where x is a real number or
Also you can type: vans+[x,y,z] if the previews answer corresponds to a cross product.
